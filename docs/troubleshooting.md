### Which wallet should I use? 
Metamask is currently the ONLY wallet supported by DEUS Swap. It works like any other ERC-20 token. 

Just manually add the token:
Assets > Add token > Custom > Token Contract Address: 0x3b62f3820e0b035cc4ad602dece6d796bc325325

### Why did I not receive my ETH after selling?
Two transactions are required in order to sell DEUS and receive your ETH. Be aware that the speed of your transaction is influenced by the gas price (GWEI) and the gas limit you set. The second transaction will come automatically after the first one is broadcasted on the blockchain. 

If you didn't confirm the second transaction, simply sell another tiny amount of DEUS and you will receive all your pending ETH. Your funds are always SAFE, even when pending! This is a security measure to help avoid flash loan attacks.

### Can I buy DEUS on Uniswap?
We do not advise users to buy from Uniswap. High slippage may occur and trading on Uniswap will not affect the bonding curve of the DEUS Swap Market Maker. Instead, we encourage you to buy DEUS directly through [DEUS Swap](https://app.deus.finance/swap) to empower and support the DEUS ecosystem. 

If you'd still rather purchase on Uniswap, you're obviously free to do so, but please watch out for FAKE-clone-tokens. Always make sure you are buying the right one by using the right contract address.
