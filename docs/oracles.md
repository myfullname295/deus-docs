description: What are oracles and why do we use them?

In order to ensure that the price of tokenized assets is equivalent to that of their real-world counterparts, the Conductor (*LINKTOCONDUCTORTAB*) needs a realiable source of information that updates continuously. Oracles exist for exactly this purpose. They allow smart contracts to operate with data from the real world.

DEUS oracles are currently being built internally, utilizing open source technology.

To make the oracles fail-safe, we will connect them to several APIs. If one of the data providers malfunctions or gets hacked, and its input significantly deviates from others, it will automatically be blocked by the smart contract, without halting the system.
