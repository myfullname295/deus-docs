##### Trading is usually refered to as a zero-sum game, because one person gaining is equivalent to another person losing. 
This, in the long-term, means that traders pay out to profits to each other. 
In the beginning, when there is an inbalance of traders, or in cases where more traders are profiting than losing, the exchange will be the entity that pays out the profits.
##### How are traders' profits collateralized?
In the event that there are more profits than losses from traders, the exchange relies on the vaults. The vaults are overcollaterized by 350% meaning for every $1 being traded there has to be $3.50 locked.
