## Key facts:
- DEUS is backed by Ethereum: [Treasury#1](https://etherscan.io/address/0xD77700fC3C78d1Cb3aCb1a9eAC891ff59bC7946D) & [Treasury#2](https://etherscan.io/address/0xc2fB644cd18325C58889Cf8BB0573e4a8774BCD2)
- Can be exchanged for Ethereum at any time on [DEUS Swap](https://app.deus.finance/swap). 
- The liquidity mining event created a price bottom for DEUS at 0.0015ETH.
- DEUS supply is infinite and DEUS price moves along the bonding curve. The curve, thus, has no upper limit.
- Buying on [DEUS Swap](https://app.deus.finance/swap) increases the supply. Higher supply means higher price. Buying on Uniswap is considered buying from a secondary market and does not increase the price/affect the bonding curve.

## Bonus for DEUS holders:
Every time a Registrar is bought on DEUS Swap, there will be a buyback in the background that mints more DEUS which results in a price increase of DEUS on DEUS Swap. Constant buybacks guarantee small yet consistent gains.

The casino always wins, and DEUS holders essentially insure the casino, getting paid no matter which way the wrapped stonks go. The bonding curve does not allow for any explosive gains or devastatingly fast crashes.

#### For example:
Currently at 1,644,162 DEUS in circulation the price is at 0.0025 ETH.
At 2,317,537 DEUS in circulation the price would be 0.005 ETH.
The config of the market maker (bonding curve) is designed so that there is a steady, linear price progression ([visualized here](https://simulate.deus.finance)).
